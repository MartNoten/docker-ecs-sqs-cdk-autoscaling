# ðŸ’¸ Deploy low cost ECS tasks based on SQS queue size with AWS CDK

In this post we are building a system that scales up and down based on the amount of messages in the SQS queue. It allows users to do REST-API calls to an Amazon API Gateway endpoint from their applications or computers. This will add a new item to the SQS queue. In turn, this will trigger your task on ECS. After you're task is finished it will delete the item from the SQS queue which will automatically scale down you're ECS cluster and task.
